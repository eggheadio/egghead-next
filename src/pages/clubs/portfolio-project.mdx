## Developer Portfolio Project Club

No matter where you are in your career, you need to prove you know what you know.

Maybe you're a bootcamp grad who has the same GitHub projects as everyone else.

You might have worked exclusively at companies that firewall your work examples behind non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) that protect their intellectual property.

Or, maybe you're a freelancer or consultant and need to showcase your skills for potential clients.

**If you're going to go further, you need to _show_, not just _tell_.**

Putting words like "React" or "AWS" in your resume and social media profiles will get you noticed, but it doesn't necessarily translate into getting you where you want to be.

You need to build your developer portfolio.

**But it's hard.**

It's hard to figure out what to build. It's hard to make the time required to work on things outside of day jobs and family time.

And it sucks to work alone, shouting into the void of the internet instead of chatting with developers building their own projects.

That's where an egghead Project Club comes in!

Each week, a group of developers of all levels and locations meets to discuss topics related to their project themes and share what they've built.

It similar to a book club, but with more focus on creating than just reading.

Clubs are often centered around a theme with group learning and study activities as a central part of the club's time together.

## Ready to get started?

Members of the egghead staff will facilitate every egghead Project Club, so you won't be expected to organize meetings or other administrative duties.

We ask that you commit to showing up and doing the work each week on your portfolio project and group learning activities. Note that club members are required to agree to the egghead Code of Conduct.

We've put together an email mini-series that will provide more information and set you up for success in a developer portfolio project club.
