## Your Audience

Folks who come to egghead are already advanced beginners, intermediate, or expert developers.

They know the basics of web development, and you can safely assume they've been writing JavaScript for at least a few months. Imagine a recent boot camp graduate or someone already working as a junior on a technical team.

They have limited knowledge about the specific thing you're teaching, but infinite intelligence.

## Tone and Voice

You should be friendly, confident, and enthusiastic.

Make your writing clear and free of unnecessary jargon. If jargon is needed, define it and link to helpful resources.

We recommend using [Hemmingway App](http://www.hemingwayapp.com/) to check the readability level of your writing.

## Mediums and Formats

Because our site is built on Next.js with MDX, you have the ability to add interactive React components into your article (we know, so cool!)

<RainbowMDX />

We strongly encourage including visual, code snippets, demos, and interactive elements that [make programming learnable](http://worrydream.com/LearnableProgramming/).
Wild, interesting experimentation with the medium of the web is very welcome here.

To cite the marvellous [Bret Victor](http://worrydream.com/):

> "programming is a way of thinking, not a rote skill" and "people understand what they can see."

**Show, don't tell**

- Sketchnotes, diagrams, and illustrated explanations
- Step-by-step scrollytelling explanations

## Examples of Great articles

## Payment

We pay a flat rate for each article.

The compensation amount is adjusted to the meatiness of the article. Long, in-depth articles that require deep research are compensated more than shorter, snappier articles.

## Cross-posting and Canonical Links

If you already have a blog or digital garden where you publish your writing, you're welcome to cross-post your article there. You just need to make sure the canonical URL links to the egghead version, and at the top of the article link to the original version on egghead.

If you're not sure how to set a canonical URL [read this guide](https://ahrefs.com/blog/canonical-tags/)
